### Done!

- October 14, 2024 - Chapter one 'complete', it does everything it needs to and nothing that it shouldn't, but it's fairly rough around the edges and needs a lot of tidying up.

- October 22, 2024 - Tokeniser has been completely re-written, and is now a stand-alone class that greatly simplifies the wider control flow, and will be the start of my attempt to make this a bit more modular - next up will be the Parser.
