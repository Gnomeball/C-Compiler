### Done!

- October 14, 2024 - Chapter one 'complete', it does everything it needs to and nothing that it shouldn't, but it's fairly rough around the edges and needs a lot of tidying up.

- October 22, 2024 - Tokeniser has been completely re-written, and is now a stand-alone class that greatly simplifies the wider control flow, and will be the start of my attempt to make this a bit more modular - next up will be the Parser.

- October 24, 2024 - Parser has been completely re-written.  Much like the Tokeniser it is now a stand-alone class that fully encapsulates its entire functionality - next up I will be focusing on proper error handling, and print-out, for the stages thus far cleaned up.

- October 25, 2024 - As a bit of fun I've written a second compiler driver, this time in Raku; it's quite a bit slower than the Python version.
